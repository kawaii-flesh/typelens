# Typelens

A VSCode plugin which adds reference counter code lenses to **typescript, javascript, scss and less** files.

Do You need support for some other language? No problem, contact the author of the extension You are using for that language and ask
politely for Symbol and Reference providers. This extension picks up references and symbols provided by those extensions, so if it is not working
properly I can't do anything about it (probably).

## It looks like this:
